## Pitch of the project
Context
Imagine being trapped in a room with a starving lion. The instinctive reaction is to freeze: a racing heart, trembling hands, and the sudden inability to speak. This intense fear mirrors what children with selective mutism, and those with social anxiety experience. Selective mutism is a phobia of speaking in specific social situations, such as at school, even though speech is normal at home. Children want to speak, but their bodies automatically shut down in response to fear.
Problem
The only evidence-based approach to improvement is gradual desensitization through extremely progressive exposure. Yet the condition remains widely misunderstood and often mistaken for shyness, leaving families without guidance and schools without tools. The impact on confidence and on daily functioning can be profound. Jenna experienced this reality with her own child and discovered how limited support systems truly are for parents, childreneducators, and health professionals.
Solution
Inspired by international CBT programs, our team aimed to develop an application for young children that integrates gamification and CBT-based exposure, positive reinforcement, and video self-modeling. 
Personalized interactive videos of the child’s teacher would enhance real-life transfer. Jenna seeks experts in VR, technology, design, and marketing to bring this life-changing tool to families and schools.
